The Car sales dataset from Kaggle contains information related to the carâ€™s make with respect to the year its price. Through our analysis, we want to find out which are the most popular brands of cars in the US. And we also aim to get to know the Used and New car Market in the US better. Moreover, this analysis will be helpful for businesses to identify the market opportunities and areas where they could include volume. It can be useful for managers to make better data-driven decisions moving forward.
